    <h1>The Importance of Class and ID</h1>

    <!-- Introduction -->
    <p>
        In web development, both <strong>classes</strong> and <strong>IDs</strong> are essential tools for applying styles and adding functionality to HTML elements.
        <!-- Classes and IDs are crucial for web development. -->

    <!-- Importance of Classes -->
    <h2 class="importance">Importance of Classes</h2>
    <p>
        Classes are used to group HTML elements together and apply common styles or behaviors to them. They are important because:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>They allow you to apply the same styles or behavior to multiple elements across your website.</li>
        <li>They promote consistency in design by ensuring that elements with the same class have a consistent look and behavior.</li>
        <li>They simplify CSS and JavaScript code by targeting elements with a shared class name.</li>
    </ul>

    <!-- Importance of IDs -->
    <h2 id="highlighted" class="importance">Importance of IDs</h2>
    <p>
        IDs are unique identifiers assigned to individual HTML elements. They are important because:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>They provide a way to uniquely identify and target a specific element within an HTML document.</li>
        <li>They are commonly used in JavaScript to perform specific actions on one particular element.</li>
        <li>They are ideal for creating anchor links that navigate to a specific section of a web page.</li>
    </ul>

    <!-- Conclusion -->
    <p>
        In conclusion, classes and IDs are fundamental in web development. Classes help maintain a consistent design and simplify styling and behavior across multiple elements, while IDs provide unique identification and precise targeting of individual elements.
