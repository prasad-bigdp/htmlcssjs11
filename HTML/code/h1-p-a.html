    <h1>What is HyperText?</h1>
    <p>Hypertext is text which is not constrained to be linear.</p>
    <p>Hypertext is text which contains <a href="">links</a> to other texts. The term was coined by <a href="">Ted Nelson</a> around 1965 (see <a href="">History</a> ).</p>
    <p>HyperMedia is a term used for hypertext which is not constrained to be text: it can include graphics, video and <a href="">sound</a> , for example. Apparently Ted Nelson was the first to use this term too.</p>
    <p>Hypertext and HyperMedia are concepts, not products.</p>
