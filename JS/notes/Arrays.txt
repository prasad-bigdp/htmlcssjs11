Arrays are used to store values
let arr=[2,5,"raj"];
Arrays are represented by square brackets and each value in the arrays stored with indexes.
index starts from 0
arr[0]=2,arr[1]=5,arr[2]="raj",
arr[3]=undefined;
-- Arrays have some default functions
arr.length -- >3 (no.of of elements in the array)
push -- is used to add the value at the end of array
pop -- is used to remove last value of array
unshift -- is used to add the value at the start of array
shift -- is used to remove first element of array
splice(starting index,dleteCount,elements to add)
-- can be used to insert/delete any values in array
concat -- is used to add arrays
indexOf('value') -- find first occurrence index of that value. if you want last one, use lastIndexOf

forEach : forEach will take a call back function and execute it for each and every element of array. it passes, first argument as value and second argument as index
let arr=[1,2,3]
let x= arr.forEach((a,b)=>{ return a*a})
forEach cannot return the value
map: map will take a call back function and execute it for each and every element of array. it passes, first argument as value and second argument as index but map will return value for element
let arr=[1,2,3]
let x= arr.map((a,b)=>{ return a*a})
console.log(x) //[1,4,9]

// filter : filter will take a callback fn which takes first argument as value and second as index and will return onlue elements whose condition is true
let arr=[1,2,3]
let x= arr.map((a,b)=> a%2==0) // [false,true,false]
let x1= arr.filter((a,b)=> a%2==0) //[2]

// reduce: reduce will take a callback function and starting value,
it will incremenet callback value everty time , update the 
previous iteration value
let arr=[1,2,3]
let x= arr.reduce((prev,curr)=>prev+curr,0)
let x= arr.reduce(function(prev,curr)
{
    return prev+curr
},0)

// some: some will take a callback which returns  true or false and will be true if atleast one value returns true
// every : every is is similar to some but all should be true
// reverse: reverse is used to reverse the array
// sort: sort is used to sort elements alphabetically,
to sort ascending arr.sort((a,b)=>a-b)
to sort descending arr.sort((a,b)=>b-a)

Objects: Objects are used to store the data in key value pair. it can store data and method
let obj={
    name:"kfc",
    age:68,
    display:function(){
        console.log("hiii")
    }
}
console.log(obj.name,obj['name'],Object.keys(obj),Object.values(obj))
