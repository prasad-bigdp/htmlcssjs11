Events are used to trigger specific times/functions
Events can be triggered in two ways:
  -- event handlers -- we use it to trigger functions from html
  -- event listners -- we use it to trigger functions from js
  element.addEventListner('event',function,?capture)

Event are 4 types
1. window events -- onLoad,onClose,onDOMContentLoaded etc..,
2. keyboard events -- keypress,keyup,keydown etc..,
3. mouse events -- onclick,onmouseOver , onMouseOut etc..,
4. formEvents -- inputs,forms like onchange,oninput,onselect,
onsubmit

event propagation: it deals how events propagate between elements.
1. bubbling: The triggering of inner most element carries to outer value
2. capturing: the triggering of outer most element  goes towrds innermost one.
