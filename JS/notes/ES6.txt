//Ecma script releases its versions for every update of JS
//In 2015 - ecmascript releases its new version ES6. this version introduces OOPS to JS and also brought lot of features.
features in ES6:
i. Arrow Function: it is a modern representation of default normal function. it also make this operator points to window
function sum(){
    console.log("simple function")
}
const sum = ()=>console.log("simple function")
'return' keyword is default in arrow functions if only one statement is there

ii. template literals: template literals are used to give dynamic detailes to strings.
eg:let pname= "shekhar" 
console.log(`the name of person is ${pname}`)

iii. rest vs spread operator:
rest and spread both operators uses three dots '...'
rest is used to bundle up remaining elements into an array
spread is used to sepate value from given array or objects

OOP(object oriented Programming):
Anything which contains set of properties.it is an instance of class
class is a collect of objects
eg: banana -- taste,color,shape
fruits is a class

--- > cars is a class, maruthi,tata,lamborgini
----> apple 12s,13,15,16

let obj-name= new classname()
class uses constructor to assign default values . 
constructor can take parameters known as paraterized constructor

classes can inherit from another using keyword extends
child class constructor should call super() to pass
values to parent class constructor

Modules:
---------
imagine multiple files are there and you need one function which is already present in another file.
There are different module systems like common js,require js etc..,
but ES6 module  sytem introduced in 2015
it contains words like import and export

Destructure
------------
you can break the structure of an array or object using destructuring
let obj={
    title:"RRR",
    status:"HIT,
    year:2013
    }
    let {title}= obj   -->// const title= obj.title
    console.log(obj.title,title)
you can even destructure an array
const arr=["KGF","VIKRAM"];
const [x,y]= arr
console.log(arr[0],x);
