Javascript is the Programming Language of Web. js is used for dynamic functionalities of websites.
JS is synchronous (line by line) , single threaded(One task at a time) programming language

Js in introduced in 1994 but initally names as livescript but later they changed the name to javascript because java is popular at 1995
Brendan Eich created js for mozilla project. for official documentation of js , we can check mdn docs

How to include Javascript into HTML?
There are two ways i. internal Js and ii. External JS
1. internal JS: 
it means we can include JS into HTML internally by using script tag

<script>
   console.log("this is interanl js")
</script>
it prints 'this is internal js' in console of brower developer tools

ii. External JS: we can even write JS externally and attach it
<script src="./index.js"></script>

it is always recommanded to add JS at the end of body.why?
always browser gives more priority to Js so that it might shows invalid html/css. 



2. what are comments and how to include comments in JS?

comments are used for readability purposes. There are two types of comments in Javascript
 i. inline comments ( you can comment any line by adding // at starting of the line). also called single line comments
 ii. multi line comments : we can comment any snippet
  within /* and */

JS uses auto semi-colon insertion for every line

3. what are variables and how many ways we can declare variables in JS?
variables also called identifiers are used to hold values which may change. to name variable, there are some rules, never start with number and no other symbol except _ but JS will not use data types while declaring variables

There are three Ways to declare / initalise the variable in Javascript
i. var : var is used to declare a variable. var is a function scoped variable
  --  var a=50; // initializing variable a with 50
  -- var a =25 // redeclare is possible with var
  --  a=55; // reassigning is possible with var
ii. let and const: let and const are block scoped variables.
  -- let b=25; // initializing a variable b with 25;
  -- let b=55; // it is wrong, redeclare is not possible using let and const
  -- b=55; // reassign is possible;
  -- const x=20;
  -- x=55; // const cannot be redeclared also

  To learn Programming Languages, there are some basics:
  -- variables
  -- data types
  -- operators
  -- control stmnts
  -- loops
  -- functions
