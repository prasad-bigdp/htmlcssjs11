Asynchronous means which takes time
JS is basically synchronous so it ignores asynchronous and when callstack got emptied , async will run
Timers
 -- setTimeOut(callback,time in milli seconds)
 -- setInterval(callback,time in milli seconds) -- it runs
 for every interval of time
 -- To stop timeOut,you can use clearTimeOut();
 -- to stop interval,you can use clearInterval()

API ( Application Programming Interface ):
API will have an end point which consists data. The API is created by Backend and used at frontend. it is the bridge that connects frontend with Backend

To access API's, we used to use
  -- XHR(xmlhttpRequests) but now browsers by default have
a method 
  --fetch to manage API
Every asynchronous function except timers will return promise
A Promise is an object which describes an eventual completion of asynchronous operation
