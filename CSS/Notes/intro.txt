pCSS means Cascading Style Sheets.CSS is used for styling/Design/layout of page
How do we connect CSS to HTML?
There are three ways
1. inline CSS: we can assign styling to certain elements in their own line called inline css
<p Style="background-color:black;> Hello world </p>
2. internal CSS: we can use style as a element in the header's end
<style>
  p{ color:red; }
</style>
3. external CSS: We can write CSS as a separate file andand cinnect them though the link

<link rel="stylesheet" href="path" />


Basic Selectors:
There are so many selectors, basic are tagname,id,class name

tagname

we can tagnames directly, it applies to all elements with that tagname
classname

classnames are identified by .classnames and these properties applies to all elements with specific class name

idname

id's are identified by # and these properties applied only element with that id

id> class > tagname

inline > internal >external
