let's understand, nth-child,nth-of-type
order of childern are p-1,div-2,p-3,div-4,p-5 ,parent class name .boxx
.boxx p:nth-child(1) means paragraph inside .boxx and child number 1, so p1 will be selected
.boxx p:nth-child(2) it selects nothing because 2nd child of boxx is not p 

we can also count from last nth-last-child
.boxx p:nth-last-child(1) seelct p5 since it is paragraph and 1st from last
.boxx p:nth-last-child(2) select nothing because 2nd child from last is not paragraph.

nth-of-type()-- selects elements based on type
.boxx p:nth-of-type(2) it selects 2nd paragraph so it is p3
we calso count this from last by nth-last-of-type
.boxx div:nth-last-of-type(1) selects div4 because it is 1st div element from last
